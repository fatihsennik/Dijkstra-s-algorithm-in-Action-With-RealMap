# Dijkstra algorithm in action with Real Map

## How Does Dijkstra's algorithm work ?
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1958 and published three years later. The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

# How to Use it ?
Click to add nodes and then right-click a node and then again right click on another node to link them each other. You can freely reposition them by dragging the nodes by holding at the center of a circle of the node and moving according to background map. In order to draw on the map effortlessly, you can enter Latitude and Longitude of Your desired location on the map and quickly go there by clicking get me there button. As for the Fun part, select starting node and then select end node and click to start to get the shortest path between selected nodes thanks to Dijkstra's algorithm.
